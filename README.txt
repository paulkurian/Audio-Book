What does this project do?
Imagine what it will feel like if your computer could talk to you! This project takes text files from the user and reads them out.
We have also added a few features. The user can:
1. Change the reading speed of the computer, 
2. Choose between a woman’s voice and a man’s voice
3. Censor out any word they wish to
 
What does each file in the folder do?
1. AMP Reader
This is the main Python file: It has all the code on which the project runs.

2. getty.txt, comedown.txt, CS101.txt, fresh.txt are some sample text files we thought you could try our platform on, 
but we really encourage you to try it on any text file of your choice. All you have to do is copy the text of your 
choice onto Notepad and save the file in the same folder as the AMP_Reader file.
