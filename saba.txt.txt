[Intro: Saba]
Ah, ay ay ay ay ay, hahaha
Yeah, yeah, ay, ay
Yeah...

[Verse 1: Saba]
Pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Use to dream about it when my cousin had a cutlass
We were making moves, 19 with the shwoop
Hit up Jay Caves, turned it to a video
Riding with the windows up because my shit is broke, just like we were broke
Coppers tryna impound vehicle, we all see ‘em though
Ay, Squeaky had a Buick he would play our latest music
I just backseat drive, catch the vibes, in a hooptie
I don’t got a crib but I tell my lady move it
She would take her sister car then someone crashed into her, ay
Yeah, I still wish it
And if it breakdown then I’m getting out and pushin'
Ay, me and Wa was on the E way and we blew the trans
Now I’m on the train, like ehe, damn
Yeah, tryna finesse uber with a new email
Ay, Saba love your story man do please tell

[Hook: Saba]
Ay, pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain’t pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Riding in this hooptie 'till the next thing coming
I'ma pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain’t pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Riding in this hooptie 'till the next thing coming, ay

[Verse 2: Saba]
Kobe whipped a station wagon and he hotbox that bih’
He'll pick me up from school,"nephew, hop in"
Came home straight skunk like I know my mama mad, ay
Still don’t smoke but I smell like my friends
All my nigga day one like they just got the job
Never bought a train card, but bet they will train hop
Ay, ay, ay, major key, tell them take a seat
Yeah, I just bought a hooptie I can get from A to B
Yeah, wasn't ally swoopin, had to stop with Casa B
Yeah, wildin' with my brother’s Waters, can’t wait till he free
Yeah, this shit sound like CTA
My new shit coming TBA
Remember they ain’t show no love
Now it’s only PDA
Yeah, that's as it stands
I just got my L’s, now I whip a minivan
Ay, high school in the ‘burb but I’m still a city man
Ay, screaming Pivot loud as fuck ‘cause that is really fam

[Hook: Saba]
Pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain’t pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Riding in this hooptie till the next thing coming
I'ma pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain’t pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Riding in this hooptie till the next thing coming, ay

[Outro: Phoelix & BJRKNC]
There are so many reasons to live alone
There is only one reason to die for you
When I'm away, know my heart, it shows
And through Jerusalem will I ride for you
