[Intro: Saba]
Ah, ay ay ay ay ay, hahaha
Yeah, yeah, ay, ay

[Verse 1: Saba]
Pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Use to dream about it when my cousin had a cutlass
We were making moves, 19 with the shwoop
Hit up Jay Caves, turned it to a video
Riding with the windows up because my shit is broke, just like we were broke
Coppers tryna impound vehicle, we all see ‘em though
Ay, Squeaky had a Buick he would play our latest music
I just backseat drive, catch the vibes, in a hooptie
I don’t got a crib but I tell my lady move it
She would take her sister car then someone crashed into her, ay
Yeah, I still wish it
And if it breakdown then I’m getting out and pushin'
Ay, me and Wa was on the E way and we blew the trans
Now I’m on the train, like ehe, damn
Yeah, tryna finesse uber with a new email
Ay, Saba love your story man do please tell
