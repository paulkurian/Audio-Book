Thank you so much for a great semester Barun!
Heres some random text we compiled from your lovely emails:
Google will be your friend during the exam, and you can bring anything you can carry (as long as its not alive). You will have no other friends (for me this is a regular occurrence), during the exam period.
What.

Obviously not. I'm a TA, not a sadist.
In case that wasn't clear enough...no new algorithms. 

I'll be in LT 110 from 11:50 to 1:20 to take doubts and discuss any material you wish to discuss. 

You may not speak to each other. You are not permitted to use your phones (this will lead to a grade drop if I catch you, regardless of why, or when, or what, barring exceptional circumstances).
Please bring your own laptops, be on time, and don't worry too much. You guys will be amazing :)

Cheers!

Any questions, feel free to mail me!

Regards,

Barun
